# Dog Breed Recognition

## Description

Develop a simple dog breed recognition system. However, with an extra difficulty: adding races that weren't seen in training time, and knowing how to identify unknowns (for example, our dear mutts).

## Requirements

To proper run this repo you need to have installed the following packages:
- Python 3.6 or superior
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Scikit-Learn
- PyTorch
- Torchvision

## Dataset

Dog Breeds dataset contains image from 100 distinct ldog-breeds to train a model. Additionally, it provides a subset for `enroll` new classes to the trained model and a final `test` set to evaluate the `enroll`.
